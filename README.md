**Computational Complexity of Supervised Learning**

Notation -
n       - the number of training sample, 
p       - the number of features, 
n_trees - the number of trees (for methods based on various trees), 
n_sv    - the number of support vectors and 
n_li    - the number of neurons at layer  i in a neural network, we have the following approximations.
